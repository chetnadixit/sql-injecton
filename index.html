        <h3 class="hover">What is SQL injection (SQLi)?</h3>
        <h3>SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. It consists of insertion or “injection” of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application.It usually occurs when you ask a user for input, like their username/userid, and instead of a name/id, the user gives you an SQL statement that you will unknowingly run on your database.

        <h2 class="hover">Impact of SQL injection</h2>
        <h3 class="impact">
            A successful SQL injection attack can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card details, or personal user information. Many high-profile data breaches in recent years have been the result of SQL injection attacks, leading to reputational damage and regulatory fines. In some cases, an attacker can obtain a persistent backdoor into an organization's systems, leading to a long-term compromise that can go unnoticed for an extended period.

        <p>
            Look at the following <strong><em>EXAMPLE </em></strong>  which creates a SELECT statement by adding a variable (txtuserid) to a select string.
            <br>
             The variable is fetched from user input (getRequestString):
<br>

Look at the example
The original purpose of the code was to create an SQL statement to select a user, with a given user id.<br>

If there is nothing to prevent a user from entering "wrong" input, the user can enter some "smart" input like this:<br>

UserId:<BR> 
105 OR 1=1<BR>

Then, the SQL statement will look like this:<br>
<a href="https://ibb.co/2YcGLx3"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/XkFcd1x/SQL-Injection-Google-Chrome-06-05-2021-02-17-27-PM-2.png" alt="SQL-Injection-Google-Chrome-06-05-2021-02-17-27-PM-2" border="0"></a>

<br>
The SQL above is valid and will return ALL rows from the "Users" table, since OR 1=1 is always TRUE.
